#USER STORIES


--As a developer, I want to build an application that displays three different images of potential products at a time 
to focus group participants. I want the images to be side-by-side,and allow the user to click on the image of the product 
they would most likely purchase.

--As a developer, I want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. 
I also want to track how many times each image is displayed, so that I can make calculations of percentages of 
each item clicked.

--As a developer,I want to design a constructor function that creates an object associated with each image, and has 
properties for the name of the image, its filepath, the number of times it has been shown, 
and the number of times it has been clicked, so that none of the images displayed next to each other are duplicate images, 
nor are they duplicates of images previously displayed.

--As a developer, I want to store, calculate and visually display the resulting data, but
I do not want any results to be shown to the participant until they have made 25 selections. 


--As a marketing research team, we want to do analysis using a focus group of random participants
 to test their potential interest in various products before putting them into the catalog, so that we can stay within Busmall's
 limited budget.
 
 --As a marketing research team, we want to take the data and calculations that the developer stored from the
 clicks of the focus group participants to be able to compare total percentages of products that are of most interest.
 
 --As a focus group participant, I want to be able to view three products at a time and be able to click on which product that 
 I would be most likely to purchase.
 
 -- As a focus group participant, I want to be able to see my total results of which products I'm most likely to buy and how that compares 
 to other participants.
